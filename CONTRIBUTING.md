# How to contribute

## Getting Started

 * Make sure you have the easiest way to use Git on Windows. [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)
 * Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
 * Fork the repository on GitHub. [SOP Chagall](https://github.com/Siragon/sop-chagall)
 * Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist. [New Issue](https://github.com/Siragon/sop-chagall/issues/new)
 * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
 * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

## Making Changes

 * Please working directly on the respective branch.
 * You can make changes, and make a pull. Send me [desarrollo03@siragon.com.ve](mailto:desarrollo03@siragon.com.ve) your username to give you access to pull or submit pull request.
 * Make commits of logical units.
 * Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
 * Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

All commits are welcome, you can make a better SOP. Good luck. Below you can see a better help for beginners.

## Clone with a click

Quickly clone repositories from your account or any organization you belong to. Want to pull down a repository from GitHub.com? Check out the Clone in Windows button.

## Adding repositories

You can add any repository already on your hard drive by dragging a folder in from Explorer. If that folder is a Git repository, GitHub for Windows will import all of the history and connect it to your GitHub accounts.

Another great way to add repositories is to clone them from GitHub.com. You can do that right in the application by browsing through your personal account and any organizations you belong to. You can also clone with one click from any repository page on GitHub.com. Just look for the Clone in Windows button.

## Submitting Changes
Make commits of logical units. 
Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

![Step tree][3]

## Stay in sync

The sync button turns the complex workflow of pulling and pushing into a single operation. It notifies you when there are new changes to pull down and lets you quickly share local changes. 

![Step four][4]

## Branch with ease

Branching is one of Git’s best features. We’ve made it easy to try out remote branches, create new local branches, and publish branches to share with others. Remember the branch **ics** is to update the system or matriz from ICS to JB. And the branch **jb** is to make some customizations from JB.

## Setting up your avatar

Git stores an email address inside of every commit you make. You can view and change your email address in the the options dialog. GitHub for Windows then uses [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) to display an avatar for that email address. If you’d like to see your face next to commits, register a [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) with the email address you use to make commits.
